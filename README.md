This repository is about solving the two reinforcement learning challenges **cartPole** and **Pendulum** of the openai gym. 

The goal was to find solutions quickly and with as simple as possible learning algorithms. 

# Algorithms
## Deep Q-learning
## Naive Q-learing
## Random actor (to compare with)

# Results
In the docs section of the experiments you can find the learned behaviour.
